Told me Mohammed bin Rafi, told us Abdul Razzaq, told us the son of Greg, the son of Shihab told me from Salim bin Abdullah, the son of Omar, said the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him if the prayer raised his hands until Tkona the example of his shoulders and large if he wanted to kneel And he did so, and if he lifted up from bowing, he did so, and he did not do it when he lifted his head from prostration.
